The To-Do List application is a simple yet effective project that
helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. By leveraging
Local Storage, the app ensures data persistence without requiring
a backend. The user-friendly interface, with a centered layout and
light orange background, enhances accessibility and ease of use.
While the current version is functional, it can be improved with
additional features like task editing, completion tracking, and
dark mode. Future enhancements, such as backend integration
and online deployment, can make it a more scalable and dynamic
application.
